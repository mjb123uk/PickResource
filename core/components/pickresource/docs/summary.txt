Pick Resource

This custom TV field is an alternative to the resource list field type.

Following installation, simply create a new TV with the input type & output type
set to pickresource. Define any required input options / filters and then use in any
resource template or part of a MIGX TV.

For extra documentation view the readme.txt or refer to http://www.mjb123.uk/pickresource.html

Enjoy using this extra field type, I hope it improves the manager experience.

Mike.
